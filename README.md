🚀 What is Soundly?
Soundly is a music-first social & dating app where your music taste defines who you connect with. Think Tinder meets Spotify, but also layered with features for musicians, music lovers, and content creators to truly vibe, match, and even build communities.

🎯 Core Idea
"Connect through sound. Find people who feel your playlist."
Whether you're looking for a date, a bandmate, or just a friend to jam with, Soundly uses your music preferences to match you. It's not just swiping — it's vibing.

2. Matching System
